The events page should include 2 cards, which contain information about four different events. Your cards should contain:
Header
Sub-header
Ion-icon

Label

The Reminders page should contain buttons that have the reminder date as the text of the button. Once the user clicks the button that has a specific date, an alert should pop up with a message explaining the date reminder. You should add at least 3-5 buttons and alerts. Each 3 buttons should be placed on the same row. The last 2 buttons should also be placed on the same row.
